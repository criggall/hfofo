# Visualizations of the Helical FOFO Snake (HFOFO)

For more on HFOFO, see Yuri Alexahin's 2015 paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07517

## 3D Model

This repository contains an interactive 3D model of the HFOFO Snake channel, accessible here: https://criggall.github.io/hfofo/


_Note_: The blue particle track represents a reference particle ($\mu^+$), and the green tracks are 20 other particles sampled from a beam distribution.


## Animations

Animated plots include:
- Periodic helical orbit of $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$
- Reference particle phase space trajectories in various planes
- Phase space evolution of $\mu^+$ beam
